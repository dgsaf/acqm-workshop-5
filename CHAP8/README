The CCC code consists of the following files with specified purposes:

ccc.f:       calls routine to read the input from file ccc.in. Generates
             exact target discrete states and pseudostates. Makes plane
             waves, calls V-matrix element routine, calls routine
             to solve the coupled equations.

iqpackd.f:   a very useful self-contained package for generating quadratures.

lapack.f:    LAPACK routines for solving linear equations.

par.f:       "included" parameter file determining the maximum number of 
             radial points, k-quadrature points, and maximum number of states.

Compilation: Create an executable program ccc by compiling the 
============ program segments ccc.f, iqpackd.f and lapack.f

             A typical command for unix-based compilers would be

                   f77 -o ccc  ccc.f iqpackd.f lapack.f

             Optimization is recommended; on some machines it may
             be necessary to suppress underflow warnings.

             The equivalent sequence on a Vax under VMS would be

                 for ccc.f
                 for iqpackd.f
                 for lapack.f
                 link ccc,iqpackd,lapack
    Note:
    ===== a) Some compiler may give warnings of the kind:
             "Character or Hollerith constant continued across lines; 
             may be non-portable". These may be ignored. 
          b) There may also be warnings regarding
             passing of unused arguments to routines. This
             is due to the fact that the code is a reduced version of
             a very large CCC code, and I decided that it is safer to
             leave the arguments much as they were. The code has been tested
             on IBM, DEC, HP, and SUN systems.

Execution:   Typical command:
==========
                ccc < ccc.in > ccc.out

input:       ccc.in  (The input files book.in, kgrid1.in, and kgrid2.in
                      should be copied to a file ccc.in before running.)

output:      ccc.out (This may be named differently in the above command.) 

A successful run will create the following additional output files:

totalcs:     contains total cross sections

singlet.n1:  singlet half-off-shell K- and V- matrix elements for channel n.

triplet.n1:  triplet half-off-shell K- and V- matrix elements for channel n.

examples:

book.in:     is a sample ccc.in file that is given in the text with
             the corresponding output.
             
kgrid1.in:   is a sample ccc.in that corresponds to a static exchange
             calculation with theta = 0. It was used to generate the
             results corresponding to the upright triangles on the
             left side of figure 1.
             
kgrid2.in:   is a sample ccc.in that corresponds to a static exchange
             calculation with theta = 0. It was used to generate the
             results corresponding to the inverted triangles on the
             left side of figure 1. The two files only differ in the
             choices for the k-grids in the last interval.
             
All the best,

Igor.
