This is the input file ccc.in
ENERGY is the projectile energy in eV
NZE    is the charge on the projectile, -1 for electrons and 1 for positrons
NATOP  if positive, is the number of states to be coupled
       If negative, then only open channels will be used.
       If zero then all of the states generated with NPS below will be used
NPS    is the size of the Laguerre basis
ALPHA  is the corresponding exponential fall-off factor, lambda = alpha * 2.0
NUNIT  is 1 for the totalcs file having cross sections in a0**2,
       is 2 for the totalcs file having cross sections in pi a0**2, and
       is 3 for the totalcs file having cross sections in cm**2
       is 0 for this file not being created
NNBTOP principle quantum number of eigenstates used to form the overlaps
       with the pseudostates.
NENT   Number of incident channels for which the data is to be calculated
IFIRST is 0 for direct only, and 1 with exchange
NOLD   0 for exact states, 1 for pseudostates
THETA  0.0 for old form of equations, > 0.0 (typically 1.0) for new form
NQM    is -1 for full k-grid, 1 for a UBA run
QCUT   largest value of k such that sin(k*r) can be integrated reliably
RMAX   largest value of r
SLOWE  if non-zero then the ALPHA is adjusted so that one of the pseudostate
       energies comes out to be SLOWE
14,0.9,22,3.0,4,4.0,10,0.2 (NK(I),SK(I),I=1,4) K grid parameters
K grid parameters as above imply 10 points within 0.2 of the channel on-shell
       point, 14 points spread between 0.0 and 0.9, 22 points between
       0.9 and 3.0, and 4 points after 3.0 with
       a transformation that assumes fall off as 1/k**4.0.
